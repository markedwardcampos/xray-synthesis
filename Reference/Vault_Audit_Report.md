# Vault Audit Report: Content Opportunities
**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Focus:** Identify high-potential content to apply the "Pragmatic Architect" guidelines.

## 🏆 Top Candidate: `My tiny Pihole.md`
**Why:** It's a perfect "High-Realism" story. It documents a project, admits failure ("Pi-hole Retired"), and pivots to a solution (AdGuard).
**The Opportunity:**
*   **Current State:** A mix of setup guide and post-mortem.
*   **Proposed Angle:** "Why I Fired Pi-hole for AdGuard: A Reliability Story."
*   **Key "Mark" Traits to Add:**
    *   **Metric of Failure:** specifics on *how* it failed (DNS timeout frequency?).
    *   **System View:** Diagram the new flow with Home Assistant Yellow.
    *   **Artifact:** The final AdGuard config or blocklist selection logic.

## 🥈 Runner Up: `How I'm using Obsidian.md`
**Why:** Meta-posts are great for setting the tone.
**The Opportunity:**
*   **Current State:** A bit generic ("AI-generated summary").
*   **Proposed Angle:** "The Anti-Fragile Vault: Why I Stopped Tweaking Obsidian."
*   **Key "Mark" Traits to Add:**
    *   **Show the Mess:** Screenshots of the "Fix these" folder.
    *   **Kill the Fluff:** Remove the "Zettelkasten" buzzwords if you aren't strictly doing it. Focus on the *actual* flow.

## 🗑️ Discard / Reference Only
*   `Migrate_Notion_Projects__Tasks_to_Airtable.md`: This is a corrupted task dump. No content here.
*   `XRay Synthesis Website Devops.md`: This is a task list for an Astro migration. Good context, but not a blog post unless you write a retrospective on "Project Management vs. Doing the Work."

## Recommendation
**Start with `My tiny Pihole.md`.** It's nearly there and allows us to practice the "Post-Mortem + Tech Guide" structure which fits your voice perfectly.
