# Memory Management System

## Context

- Applies to all project development
- Ensures consistent state tracking between chats
- Centralizes project knowledge

## Requirements

- Reference memory file at the start of each conversation
- Keep memory file updated with current project state
- Track tasks separately in todo list
- Follow review process for completed features

## Remember Everything In Memory

Remember everything in @memory.md.

## Memory File Purpose

There will be a memory file (@memory.md) for every project.

The memory file will contain:

- The current state of the project
- Important architectural decisions
- Implementation details
- Requirements and constraints
- Any notes or relevant details needed between chat sessions

## Memory Maintenance Guidelines

Keep the memory file up to date based on the project's current state by:

- Adding new architectural decisions
- Updating project structure information
- Documenting API changes
- Recording important implementation details
- Noting dependencies and their versions
- Documenting environment setup requirements

## Memory vs Todo Distinction

Do not annotate task completion in the memory file. Task completion will be tracked in the to-do list (@todo.md).

## Memory Initialization

If the memory file is empty or missing, create it with appropriate sections based on the project's current state.

## Review Process

When a feature or large change is completed:

1. Run all tests
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Address all warnings
4. Review changed files:
   - Run `git diff --name-only main` to get a list of changed files
   - Review each file according to the guidelines in the project memory
5. Review the todo list and verify all tasks are completed
6. Update the project memory with new relevant information
7. Evaluate what should be added to the development guidelines
8. Commit changes according to the development guidelines

## Memory File Access

At the beginning of each conversation, review the contents of @memory.md to ensure full context about the project.
