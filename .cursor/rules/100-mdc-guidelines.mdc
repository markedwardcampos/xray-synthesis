# Document Structure Requirements
structure:
  required_sections:
    - frontmatter
    - title
    - context
    - content_sections

  optional_sections:
    - version
    - last_updated
    - examples
    - implementations
    - related_files

# File Organization Rules
file_organization:
  location: ".cursor/rules/"
  naming_convention: "kebab-case with .mdc extension"

# Document Components
components:
  frontmatter:
    position: "Top of file"
    required_fields:
      - description: "Single sentence, clear purpose"
      - globs: "Comma-separated list of relevant file patterns"
    example: |
      ---
      description: Guidelines for implementing feature X
      globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}
      ---

  annotations:
    syntax: "@annotation_name JSON_content"
    placement: "Before relevant sections"
    format: "Valid JSON with proper indentation"
    types:
      context: "Project and document context"
      rules: "List of rules or requirements"
      format: "Format specifications"
      options: "Available options"
      examples: "Implementation examples"
      implementations: "Full implementation details"
      related: "Related documentation or code"

  content_structure:
    headings:
      h1: "Single main title"
      h2: "Major sections"
      h3: "Subsections"
      h4: "Detailed points"

    code_blocks:
      syntax: "Always specify language"
      examples: "Include practical examples"
      formatting: "Use proper indentation"
      context: "Add explanatory comments"

# Best Practices
best_practices:
  organization:
    sections: "Use clear hierarchical structure"
    annotations: "Place before relevant content"
    examples: "Include practical examples"

  formatting:
    json: "Properly formatted, valid JSON"
    markdown: "Clean, consistent spacing"
    code: "Language-specific syntax highlighting"

  metadata:
    annotations: "Use semantic names"
    context: "Provide clear scope"
    versioning: "Include version information"

# Implementation Guidelines
implementation:
  code_examples:
    completeness: "Must be fully functional"
    types: "Include all necessary type information"
    imports: "Show all required imports"
    context: "Provide setup and usage context"

  documentation:
    inline: "Add explanatory comments"
    types: "Document type constraints"
    errors: "Document error conditions"
    usage: "Show usage patterns"

# Common Patterns
common_patterns:
  rules_section:
    format: "array of objects"
    properties:
      - id
      - severity
      - description
    example:
      - id: "rule_name"
        severity: "error"
        description: "Clear description"

  implementation_section:
    format: "object with implementation details"
    required:
      - language
      - types
      - validation
    example:
      language: "typescript"
      types:
        Type1: "Description"
      validation:
        rule1: "Description"

# Common Mistakes to Avoid
common_mistakes:
  - id: "missing_frontmatter"
    wrong: "Starting directly with content"
    correct: "Include frontmatter at top"
    reason: "Frontmatter is required for Cursor to properly parse the file"

  - id: "invalid_json"
    wrong: "Malformed JSON in annotations"
    correct: "Properly formatted JSON with quotes around keys"
    reason: "Annotations must contain valid JSON for proper parsing"

  - id: "inconsistent_structure"
    wrong: "Mixed levels of headings"
    correct: "Clear hierarchical structure"
    reason: "Consistent structure helps with readability and parsing"

  - id: "nonexistent_files"
    wrong: "Referencing files that don't exist in the workspace"
    correct: "Only reference files that exist and have been verified"
    reason: "Prevents broken links and maintains documentation integrity"

# Validation Requirements
validation:
  required:
    - "Frontmatter must be present and valid"
    - "All JSON must be properly formatted"
    - "Main title must be present"
    - "At least one content section"
    - "Complete implementation examples when relevant"
    - "All referenced files must exist in the workspace"

  recommended:
    - "Version information"
    - "Last updated date"
    - "Clear examples"
    - "Proper code formatting"
    - "Type definitions"
    - "Validation rules"
    - "Verify file existence before referencing"

# Example Structure
examples:
  minimal: |
    ---
    description: A simple example MDC file
    globs: **/*.example

    # Example Rules
    @context {
        "type": "example",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    }
    ## Section One
    @rules [

            "id": "rule_one",
            "severity": "error",
            "description": "Description of rule one"
        }
